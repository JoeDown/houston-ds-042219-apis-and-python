    "## The Many Use Cases for APIs\n",
    "APIs can actually be used for many things - not just for retrieving information. Twilio has an API that allows you to write a script to call their API to send text messages to people. GitHub has an API for creating new repositories. Many services have an API allowing a computer to automate a task that a person might otherwise have to do through a website - whether uploading a photo to Flickr, searching for a company name in a state database or getting a list of garbage collection times for a municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of APIs\n",
    "When working with APIs, there are some limitations you have to be aware of - especially relating to scope and scale.\n",
    "* **Scope** - Just because a company has an API and has information, it doesn't mean you can get all of the information through their API. Any time you want to get information from a given API, write a small test script and make sure it actually allows you to access the things you need in the way you require.\n",
    "* **Scale** - Some APIs are provided for free as a public service. Others you have to pay for, or allow you to perform activities (like sending a text message) that you pay for. Whatever the commercial model, all APIs have some kind of rate limiting. Because it costs money to keep computers running and because you could write a script to ask lots and lots of questions of an API, generally an API will have some kind of limitations on the number of \"API calls\" you can make against the service per unit of time. Make sure that you know what the rate limits are and that your use case isn't going to need more API calls than you will be able to make.\n",
